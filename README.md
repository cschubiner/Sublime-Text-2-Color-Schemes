# Colour Schemes

## Installation

### Sublime Text 2

For the sublime text 2 editor the themes can be installed easily by using [Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control) to install the 'Clay Schubiner Color Schemes' package from the official repository.


## Thanks!

Thanks to Dayle Rees for inspiring many of the color schemes!
